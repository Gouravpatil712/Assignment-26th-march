    "Simple linear regression involves modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and a single independent variable. For example, we could use simple linear regression to model the relationship between a student's test score (dependent variable) and the number of hours they studied (independent variable).

    "Linear regression is a widely used statistical method for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. However, linear regression models are based on certain assumptions that must be met in order for the results to be valid and reliable. These assumptions include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Linearity: The relationship between the dependent variable and independent variables should be linear. This means that the change in the dependent variable should be proportional to the change in the independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Independence: The observations in the dataset should be independent of each other. This means that the value of the dependent variable for one observation should not be related to the value of the dependent variable for another observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Homoscedasticity: The variance of the residuals (the difference between the predicted and actual values of the dependent variable) should be constant across all levels of the independent variables. This means that the spread of the residuals should be roughly the same at all points in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Normality: The residuals should be normally distributed. This means that the distribution of the residuals should be symmetric and bell-shaped.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. No multicollinearity: The independent variables should not be highly correlated with each other. This means that the independent variables should be linearly independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "To check whether these assumptions hold in a given dataset, there are several diagnostic tools and techniques that can be used:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Residual plots: Plotting the residuals against the predicted values can help to identify any patterns or trends in the residuals that violate the assumptions of linearity and homoscedasticity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Normal probability plots: Plotting the residuals against a normal distribution can help to identify any departures from normality.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Cook's distance: Cook's distance is a measure of the influence of each observation on the regression model. High values of Cook's distance indicate that an observation may be influential and should be examined more closely.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Variance inflation factor (VIF): VIF is a measure of multicollinearity among the independent variables. High values of VIF indicate that the independent variables may be highly correlated and may need to be removed from the model.\n",

    "Suppose the estimated coefficients for this model are β0 = $30,000 and β1 = $5,000.

Therefore, we can interpret the slope coefficient as the average increase in salary per year of experience.\n",

    "Gradient descent is an iterative optimization algorithm that is widely used in machine learning to find the optimal parameters of a model by minimizing a cost function. The basic idea of gradient descent is to iteratively adjust the parameters of the model in the opposite direction of the gradient of the cost function until the algorithm reaches a minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "The gradient is a vector that points in the direction of the steepest increase in the cost function, and the negative of the gradient points in the direction of the steepest decrease. Therefore, by moving in the direction of the negative gradient, we can iteratively decrease the cost function until we reach a minimum.\n",

Batch gradient descent computes the gradient of the cost function over the entire training set, while stochastic gradient descent computes the gradient over a single training example at a time. Mini-batch gradient descent is a compromise between the two, computing the gradient over a small random subset of the training set.\n",

By iteratively adjusting the parameters of the model, gradient descent can find the optimal parameters that minimize the cost function and improve the performance of the model. However, the choice of the learning rate and convergence criteria can affect the performance of the algorithm and may require careful tuning."

    "Polynomial regression is a type of regression analysis in which the relationship between the independent variable x and the dependent variable y is modeled as an nth-degree polynomial function.
